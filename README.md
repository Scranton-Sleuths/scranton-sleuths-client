CLIENT for the game. Server code is in the other repo.

This will use the npm package Phaser eventually.

To run locally:
* Install npm/node
* In src/index.js, you need to comment/uncomment the correct line to use localhost. Look in the code for how/what to do.
* Run the following commands:
    * `npm install`
    * `npm start`
